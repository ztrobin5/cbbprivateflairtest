Inline flair allows you to display images like [](#l/rcbbprivateflairtest) in a line or in a table.

The format for doing so is \[/r/cbbprivateflairtest](#l/rcbbprivateflairtest), where you replace "rcbbprivateflairtest" with the desired tag.  We use the '#l/' prefix so that:

* We can modify all flairs at once, which preserves significant space in our stylesheet which is limited by Reddit
* Clicking on inline flair no longer takes you to a blank page, but keeps you on the current page.  The flair still are not links, but this is preferable to a link to nowhere.

The prefixes are as follows:

* #f for team flair
* #i for images
* #l for other logos, including conferences, networks, playoffs, and bowls

Writing the team name in brackets helps out our mobile users on apps that can't see the images, so that they can at least see a label for the image you are talking about.

Additionally, if you want to hide text from being shown unless a user hovers over it, use the spoiler tag like this:

* \[Hidden information](#s/spoiler), which appears as [Hidden information](#s/spoiler)

D1 teams each have intuitive shorcuts.  Due to space constraints from Reddit, all teams can be listed in line, but the codes for non-D1 teams are a bit more complicated.
